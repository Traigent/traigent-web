    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: December 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>This Refund Policy explains when and how refunds are issued for Traigent Ltd.'s cloud Service. All payments and refunds are processed by Paddle.com Market Limited ("Paddle"), our Merchant of Record.</p>

    <h2>2. Free Trial</h2>
    <p>We offer a 7-day free trial. If you cancel before the trial ends, you will not be charged. If a payment method is on file and you do not cancel, your chosen plan will start automatically at the end of the trial.</p>

    <h2>3. Subscription Refunds</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Annual plans:</strong> Prorated refunds are available within 30 days of purchase or renewal.</li>
      <li><strong>Monthly plans:</strong> No refunds for partial months; access continues until the end of the current billing period.</li>
      <li><strong>Billing errors/duplicates:</strong> Refunded in full when reported within 30 days.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Usage and Overage Charges</h2>
    <p>Usage beyond your plan's included allocation is billed per optimization trial as shown on the pricing page and at checkout. Usage/overage charges already incurred are not refundable.</p>

    <h2>5. Non-Refundable Items</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Usage/overage charges already consumed</li>
      <li>Monthly subscription fees after the billing period has begun</li>
      <li>Annual fees after the 30-day refund window</li>
      <li>Third-party AI provider costs you incur directly with those providers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. How to Request a Refund</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Email <a href="mailto:billing@traigent.ai">billing@traigent.ai</a> with your account email and reason for the request.</li>
      <li>We typically respond within 3 business days.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Processing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Approved refunds are processed by Paddle to the original payment method.</li>
      <li>Refunds usually appear within 5–10 business days, depending on your bank or payment provider.</li>
      <li>Refunds are issued in the original currency of payment and include applicable taxes collected on the original charge.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Cancellation and Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cancel anytime through your account or by contacting us; access remains until the current period ends.</li>
      <li>We retain your optimization data for 30 days after expiration, then delete it upon request, except for records we must keep (e.g., billing records for up to 7 years; support communications as legally required).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Consumer Rights</h2>
    <p>Nothing in this policy affects any statutory rights you may have under applicable consumer protection laws.</p>
