    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: December 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Traigent Ltd. ("Traigent", "we", "us") is incorporated in Israel and provides an AI agent optimization platform. Contact: <a href="mailto:legal@traigent.ai">legal@traigent.ai</a>.</p>

    <h2>2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using our cloud service (the "Service"), you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>3. What the Service Covers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Automated exploration and optimization of AI agent configurations</li>
      <li>Cost, latency, and accuracy trade-off analysis</li>
      <li>Recommendations and deployment-ready artifacts</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Open-source SDK:</strong> We also offer an open-source SDK under the Apache 2.0 license. The SDK is governed by that license, not these Terms. These Terms apply to the cloud Service.</p>
    <p><strong>Third-party AI provider costs:</strong> You are responsible for any fees charged by third-party AI providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) when you use your own API keys. Traigent does not control or bill for those provider fees.</p>

    <h2>4. Accounts and Security</h2>
    <p>You must keep your credentials confidential and are responsible for all activity under your account. Notify <a href="mailto:security@traigent.ai">security@traigent.ai</a> of any suspected unauthorized access.</p>

    <h2>5. Free Trial</h2>
    <p>We offer a 7-day free trial. If a payment method is collected, you will be charged the plan price at the end of the trial unless you cancel. If no payment method is collected, access will downgrade to the free tier unless you subscribe.</p>

    <h2>6. Plans and Pricing</h2>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Plan</th><th>Price (monthly)</th><th>Included usage</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Free</td><td>$0</td><td>3 optimization trials, up to 20 configurations per trial</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Individual</td><td>$20</td><td>10 optimization trials, up to 100 configurations per trial</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Team</td><td>$50</td><td>30 optimization trials, up to 300 configurations per trial, 3 seats</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Enterprise</td><td>Custom</td><td>Custom limits, dedicated support, SLA available</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>Prices are base amounts; applicable taxes are calculated and added at checkout by Paddle based on your location.</p>

    <h2>7. Usage-Based Charges</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Your plan includes a monthly allocation of optimization trials and a maximum number of configurations per trial (see §6 above).</li>
      <li>An "optimization trial" is counted when you initiate an optimization run. Configurations are the parameter combinations tested within each trial.</li>
      <li>If you exceed your plan's trial or configuration limits, additional usage may be billed at the overage rate shown at checkout, or access may be restricted until the next billing period.</li>
      <li>Overage charges are in addition to your subscription fee and any third-party AI provider costs you incur directly.</li>
      <li>Overage charges already incurred are non-refundable.</li>
      <li>Usage resets each billing period. We will notify you when you approach your limits where technically feasible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Payment and Billing</h2>
    <p><strong>Merchant of Record:</strong> Payments are processed by Paddle.com Market Limited ("Paddle"), who handles billing, tax, invoicing, and refunds. You purchase from Paddle, which then provides access to the Service.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Auto-renewal:</strong> Plans renew automatically each billing period unless cancelled.</li>
      <li><strong>Invoices:</strong> Issued by Paddle to your registered email and available in the Paddle portal.</li>
      <li><strong>Disputes:</strong> Contact <a href="mailto:billing@traigent.ai">billing@traigent.ai</a> within 30 days of a charge for billing questions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Refunds</h2>
    <p>See our <a href="/refund">Refund Policy</a> for details. Summary:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Annual subscriptions: prorated refunds within 30 days of purchase or renewal.</li>
      <li>Monthly subscriptions: no refunds for partial months.</li>
      <li>Billing errors/duplicates: refunded in full.</li>
      <li>Overage/usage charges already consumed: non-refundable.</li>
      <li>Refunds are processed by Paddle to the original payment method; statutory rights are preserved.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Cancellation and Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cancel anytime; access continues through the current billing period.</li>
      <li>We retain your optimization data for 30 days after cancellation/expiration, then delete it upon request unless we must retain certain records (e.g., billing records for up to 7 years; support communications for required periods).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to: (a) use the Service unlawfully; (b) attack or probe the Service; (c) interfere with or disrupt other customers; (d) reverse engineer the platform; (e) use the Service to build a competing offering; or (f) exceed reasonable usage limits or abuse free trials.</p>

    <h2>12. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Service, including content, features, and underlying technology, is owned by Traigent Ltd. Your subscription grants a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Service.</p>

    <h2>13. Availability and SLA</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available." We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability. SLAs are available for Enterprise plans via separate agreement.</p>

    <h2>14. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Third-party AI services are outside our control.</p>

    <h2>15. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TRAIGENT LTD. WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR BUSINESS. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE IS LIMITED TO THE FEES YOU PAID IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM.</p>

    <h2>16. Governing Law and Venue</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Israel. Courts in Tel-Aviv, Israel have exclusive jurisdiction, subject to any non-waivable consumer rights under applicable law.</p>

    <h2>17. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms. Material changes will be notified via email or in-product at least 30 days before they take effect. Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.</p>
